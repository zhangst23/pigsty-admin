# Contributing to Pigsty

Welcome to Pigsty! We're excited that you're interested in contributing.

Pigsty is an open-source, cloud-neutral, local-first PostgreSQL distribution that delivers production-ready database clusters.
Your feedback and ideas help make PostgreSQL more accessible and powerful for everyone.


## Ways to Contribute

### Report Bugs

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/issues) first to avoid duplicates
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Include your Pigsty version, OS version, and relevant configuration
- Attach logs and error messages when applicable

### Request Features

- Describe your use case and why the feature would be valuable
- Explain your current workaround (if any)
- Be specific about expected behavior

### Suggest Extensions

Pigsty supports 555 PostgreSQL extensions. If you need an extension that's not included:

- Open an issue describing the extension and your use case
- Include links to the extension's repository/documentation
- Specify which PostgreSQL versions you need it for

### Propose Config Templates

If your scenario isn't covered by existing templates in the `conf/` directory, we'd love to hear about it:

- Target environment (cloud provider, hardware specs, OS)
- Workload characteristics (OLTP, OLAP, mixed)
- Special requirements (compliance, performance, HA topology)

Good suggestions may be incorporated into future releases.

### Suggest Docker App Templates

The `app/` directory contains Docker Compose templates for applications that work well with PostgreSQL:

```
app/
├── supabase/    # Firebase alternative
├── ferretdb/    # MongoDB alternative
├── bytebase/    # DDL migration tool
├── gitea/       # Git service
├── nocodb/      # Airtable alternative
├── dify/        # AI workflow platform
└── ...
```

If you have ideas for new app templates, please open an issue with:

- The application name and what it does
- Why it pairs well with PostgreSQL
- Any specific configuration considerations
- Links to official documentation

### Suggest Grafana Dashboards

Dashboards are located in `files/grafana/` with subdirectories for each module (pgsql, node, infra, redis, etc.).

If you have ideas for new dashboards or improvements to existing ones, please describe them in an issue.
