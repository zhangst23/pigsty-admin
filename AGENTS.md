## Important Files

**`pigsty.yml`**, source of truth of this deployment, always read it to understand current environment.
Sometimes the real state may drift from the config file, especially after manual changes / failover. trust by verify.

**`files/pki/ca/ca.key`** - highly sensitive CA private key. Keep it safe, never share it, don't lose it.

If `pig` cli is available, you can use it to perform operation command with caution. https://pigsty.io/docs/pig


---

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Before Any Change

1. **Identify scope:** Which cluster? Which nodes?
2. **Check current state:** `pig pg list`, system status
3. **Verify backup:** `pig pb info` - is backup recent?
4. **Dry run first:** Add `--check` to playbook

### For Dangerous Operations

1. **Confirm with user** - even in YOLO mode
2. **Verify backup exists and is recent**
3. **Ask user to type exact target name**
4. **Execute with explicit `-l` limit flag**

### Incident Response

1. Read logs first, understand the situation, you can get it from `/pg/log`, or query victorialogs API
2. Check Patroni/HA status
3. Do NOT take any action without user confirmation
4. Recommend rollback/recovery options before executing

---

## Permission Boundaries

### ALWAYS ALLOWED (No confirmation needed)

**Read-only operations:**
- Read `pigsty.yml` configuration file
- Read Ansible inventory and playbook files
- Read system monitoring metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Read PostgreSQL/Patroni cluster status via `pg list`, `patronictl`
- Read backup status via `pb info`, `pgbackrest info`
- Read service status via `systemctl status`
- Read logs: `/pg/log/`, system journal, nginx access logs
- Query monitoring dashboards and Grafana metrics
- Dry-run playbooks with `--check` flag
- Read extension catalog and documentation

**Diagnostic commands:**
- `pig pg list <cluster>` - Patroni cluster status
- `pig pb info` - Backup information
- System health: `df`, `free`, `uptime`, `ps`, `top`, etc.


---

### REQUIRES USER CONFIRMATION (Always ask first)

**Cluster lifecycle operations:**
- `pgsql.yml` - Initialize PostgreSQL cluster
- `pgsql-user.yml` - Create/modify users
- `pgsql-db.yml` - Create/modify databases
- `node.yml` - Provision nodes
- `infra.yml` - Deploy infrastructure
- Any playbook execution without `--check`

**Configuration changes:**
- Modify `pigsty.yml`
- Change `pg_hba.conf` or HBA rules
- Modify PostgreSQL parameters
- Change Patroni configuration
- Update haproxy/vip configuration

**Service operations:**
- Restart PostgreSQL/Patroni services
- Reload configuration (`pg_reload_conf()`)
- Switchover primary/replica (`pg switchover`)
- Backup execution (`pg-backup`)

---

### FORBIDDEN - ALWAYS ASK (Even in YOLO mode)

**Destructive operations - require explicit confirmation + backup verification:**

Running Ansible playbooks, especially init/remove playbooks, always requires explicit user consent and permission, even in YOLO mode. Improper use may cause data loss! Your policy should be deny-by-default unless the user explicitly authorizes and requests. If you believe the user doesn't fully understand what they're doing, you should pause execution, explain and clarify further, and only proceed after confirming the user truly understands what they're about to do.

```
NEVER execute without user saying "yes, I confirm":

- pgsql-rm.yml      # Remove PostgreSQL cluster
- node-rm.yml       # Remove node from cluster
- infra-rm.yml      # Remove infrastructure
- redis-rm.yml      # Remove Redis cluster
- etcd-rm.yml       # Remove etcd cluster
- minio-rm.yml      # Remove MinIO cluster

- DROP DATABASE     # Delete database
- DROP TABLE        # Delete table
- TRUNCATE          # Clear table data
- DELETE without WHERE  # Mass deletion

- rm -rf /pg/*      # Delete data directories
- rm -rf ~/pigsty   # Delete Pigsty installation
- rm pigsty.yml     # Delete configuration
- rm -rf files/pki  # Delete PKI certificates

- patronictl remove # Remove cluster member
- pg_ctl stop -m immediate  # Force stop
```

**Must verify before any destructive operation:**
1. Ask: "Which cluster/database/table?"
2. Ask: "Do you have a recent backup?"
3. Ask: "Type the exact name to confirm"

---

### BUSINESS DATA - RESTRICTED ACCESS

**Default policy: DO NOT read business data without permission**

You may NOT execute these without explicit user consent:
- `SELECT * FROM <user_tables>`
- Read application data tables
- Export or dump business data
- Access data in `/pg/data/` directly

**Allowed for diagnostics (system tables only):**
- `pg_stat_*` views
- `pg_catalog.*` system catalogs
- `information_schema.*`
- Extension metadata tables

**If user needs data analysis:**
1. Ask which tables/data are needed
2. Confirm user authorizes access
3. Limit query scope (use LIMIT, specific columns)
4. Never store or transmit sensitive data
